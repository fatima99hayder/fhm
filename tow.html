<h1>BASIC FACTS ABOUT LION <br>Renowned for its majesty and nicknamed "the king of the jungle" <br>the lion possesses both beauty and strength</h1>
<p1>
<h2>BEHAVIOR</h2>
The only social member of the cat (Felidae) family, lions live in large groups called "prides,"<br>
consisting of about 15 lions. Related females and their young make up the majority of the pride.<br>
A single male, or sometimes a small group of 2-3 males, will join a pride for an indefinite period,<br>
usually about 3 years or until another group of males takes over.Lions within a pride are often<br>
affectionate and, when resting,

<li>seem to enjoy good fellowship with lots of touching</li>
<li>head rubbing</li>
<li>licking and purring.</li>
</ol>
</p1><br><br>
<p2 >
The males are territorial, and will roar and use scent markings to establish their domains.<br>
Females do almost all of the hunting. They are mainly nocturnal and work in teams to stalk and<br>
ambush prey. Lions inhabit grassy plains, savannahs, open woodlands and scrub country.<br>
These landscapes allow the hunters to creep stealthily through vegetation <br>
and leap upon their unsuspecting prey.

Lions are the only cats that live in groups, which are called prides. <br>
Prides are family units that may include up to three males, a dozen or so females, and their young. <br>
All of a pride's lionesses are related, and female cubs typically stay with the group as they age.<br><br>
